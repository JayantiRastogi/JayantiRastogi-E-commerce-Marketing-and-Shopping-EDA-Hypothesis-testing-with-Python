E-commerce Marketing and Shopping EDA & Hypothesis Testing
Problem Statement:
Analyze two datasets—one on shopping behavior and another on demographic, purchase, and marketing data—to gain insights into customer behavior, purchase decisions, and areas for optimization.

Approach:
  * EDA:

    Preprocess data, analyze distributions, and identify correlations.
    Visualize user behavior and purchase trends across categories.
    Segment users by demographics and analyze engagement patterns.
  * Hypothesis Testing:

    Test if income is dependent on education.
    Analyze spending patterns across income levels and marital status.
    Test if lower-income customers are more likely to accept campaigns.

    
Expectations:
  Gain insights into factors affecting user purchases.
  Validate hypotheses using statistical tests.
  Suggest optimizations for engagement and marketing strategies.
